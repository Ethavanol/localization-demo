# Localization Example
This example introduces Jason agents that localize within a partially observable environment.

## Limitations Imposed on Agent:

- No access to map data. The agent must localize using data it has already perceived.
- Agents do not know their location on the map (only their immediate north/south/east/west cell perceptions).
